# High Frequency Trading - InceptionTime (Convolutional Neural Networks)

A 3-class classification task that uses a variant of the **"InceptionTime"** Convolutional Neural Network architecture to predict short-term directional movements in mid price based on raw-LOB data.

## Project Overview

This project adapts the **"InceptionTime"** CNN architecture and applies it to directional classification in high frequency trading. The **"InceptionTime"** architecture was proposed in the 2019 paper “InceptionTime: Finding AlexNet for Time Series Classification.”. The architecture applies convolutions at several receptive field sizes simultaneously to look for short, medium, and long term patterns in a time series. Unlike many traditional time-series methods this allows it to identify multiple temporal structures that a single-scale window would miss.
